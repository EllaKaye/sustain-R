- R is a programming language for statistical computing and data science
- Originally developed by academics, now widely used across sectors and domains
- Used for critical “production” applications (e.g., COVID-19 modelling), as well as prototyping
- Core R project underpins >20,000 packages
:::

## Sustainability

Those who contributed the most to R early on are now near the end of their careers, only partially replaced by new contributors.

```{r}
#| fig.align: center
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "r_core_commits.png"))
```


::: {.notes}
- Originally developed by academics, core R underpins >20,000 packages
- Early on, strong group of heavy committers supported by wide group of regular committers
- Heavy committers now towards end of their careers
- Regular committers only partially replaced by new members
-Similar for developer community

## Benefits of a diverse community

- Increasing innovation
- Increasing sustainability
- Decreased duplication of effort as people work together

. . . 

:::{.callout-note}
## Personal reflection
- A diverse, welcoming community is pleasurable to be involved in (as opposed to off-putting) 
- Motivates a desire to contribute.
:::

# Initiatives {.inverse}

## Building a diverse contributor community

R Contribution Working Group est. July 2020

- Social media (Blog, Slack, Twitter, Mastodon)
- Novice-friendly documentation
- Short-term paid projects (GSoC, GSoD)
- Events for novice contributors

[Prioritising engagement with people from under-represented groups]{.larger150 .primary}

::: {.notes}
before moving to next slide:
So, we want more contributors, but to do what?
:::

# {.inverse .center-h .middle}

[**bugs**]{.larger200}

<br>

[**translations**]{.larger200}

::: {.notes}
Will talk about both, in the context of both events and infrastructure
:::


## Event: Collaboration Campfires

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Series of four 90-minute sessions introducing ways to contribute
- Informal, exploratory, interactive
- Targeted outreach to people from underrepresented groups

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/collaboration-campfires.jpg)
:::

::::

## Campfire Topic: Bug Handling

- Exploring R's Bugzilla: <https://bugs.r-project.org>
- Diagnosing bugs

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics('figures/bug_status.png')
```

::: {.notes}
lots unconfirmed - confirming they are really bugs is something that novice contributors can do  
:::

## Campfire Topic: Localisation/translation

- Exploring status of translations
- Contributing translations

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"
#| eval: true
knitr::include_graphics("figures/translation_status.png")
```

::: {.notes}
translations of messages
Spanish is an interesting case, given large Spanish-speaking userbase
:::

::: {.notes}
Really easy to sign up for an account and translate a few messages, can be done in minutes
Great way to get started with contributing if you speak another language (or UK English)

## C book club for R contributors 

- For existing/aspiring R contributors that want to learn/refresh their C programming skills.
- May 16th--Aug 22nd, online every two weeks, 1-2pm BST Tuesdays
- Main reading is [Modern C](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c/) by Jens Gustedt, supplemented by selected exercises from [C Programming: A Modern Approach](http://knking.com/books/c2/) by K. N. King.
- Commitment ~2hrs a week
- <https://github.com/r-devel/c-book-club/>

::: {.notes}
- Much of R is written in C
- Originally conceived for R Sprint participants, but open to all
- Modern C pdf freely available online
- At the online meetings, one book club member will present a summary of the chapter (~10 minutes), reviewing the main points and highlighting any quotes/examples they found particularly helpful/important. This will be followed by discussion, sharing exercise solutions, etc. Book club members are encouraged to sign up to present at one session to spread the load among the group.
- Possibly a second cohort 7-8pm PDT (3am BST!)
